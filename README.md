Official implementation of the paper:
A Physical Soft-constraint Interpretability-based Multimodal Deep Learning Model for Small-sample Fault Diagnosis of Pressurized Water Reactor Coolant Systems in Nuclear Power Plants

üìñ Introduction
This repository contains the code for a novel multimodal deep learning framework designed for fault diagnosis in nuclear power plant coolant systems. The model addresses two critical challenges in nuclear safety:

Extreme scarcity of fault samples (only 30 original samples available)

Black-box nature of traditional deep learning models

Key innovations include:

üß™ Physics-guided data augmentation: Expands 30 samples to 330 physically consistent samples using pressure-flow constraints, non-negativity constraints, and temperature boundaries

üß† Multimodal fusion architecture: Integrates Mamba blocks for temporal modeling, CNN for spatial feature extraction, and physics processors for domain knowledge

‚öñÔ∏è Differentiable physical constraints: Embeds energy/mass conservation laws as soft regularization terms in loss function

üí¨ Natural language explanations: Generates human-readable diagnostic reports with 96.7% expert agreement
‚ú® Key Features
11x sample expansion while maintaining physical consistency

99.97% diagnostic accuracy with only 0.192M parameters

32% reduction in physical constraint violations

Triple interpretability:

Feature importance weights

Physical rule verification

Natural language explanations

Dynamic hybrid loss optimization: Balances data-driven and physics-based learning
